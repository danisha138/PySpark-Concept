Q10. What would inferSchema do while reading a file?
inferSchema scan the input file and assign the schema to data frame.
By default inferSchema is false, you can enforce it by setting it
true while reading the data.

It can slowdown the loading if data size is too large.
It is preferrable to define schema instead to avoid any surprises.
This could be beneficial if you are input data schema is dynamic and keep on changing.
