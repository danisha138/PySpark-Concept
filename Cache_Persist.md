How "Cache & Persist" can be explained in step by step manner

Interviewer: Can you explain how you can leverage cache and persist when using Spark?

Interviewee: Yes! Cache and persist are powerful techniques in Spark that allow us to optimize the performance of our Spark applications by efficiently managing data in memory and disk.

Interviewer: How can you use these techniques

effectively?

Interviewee: One way to leverage cache and persist is to use them strategically in our Spark data pipelines. When we have intermediate datasets that are reused multiple times in our computations, we can use the cache() method to store those datasets in memory. This prevents the need to recompute the same data repeatedly, resulting in significant time savings.

Interviewer: How about persisting data to disk?

Interviewee: Persisting data to disk using the persist() method is useful when we have limited memory and need to manage the memory footprint carefully. We can choose to persist certain datasets to disk rather than keeping them all in memory. This ensures that our Spark application runs efficiently and avoids potential Out of Memory (OOM) errors.
