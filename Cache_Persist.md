How "Cache & Persist" can be explained in step by step manner

Interviewer: Can you explain how you can leverage cache and persist when using Spark?

Interviewee: Yes! Cache and persist are powerful techniques in Spark that allow us to optimize the performance of our Spark applications by efficiently managing data in memory and disk.

Interviewer: How can you use these techniques effectively?

Interviewee: One way to leverage cache and persist is to use them strategically in our Spark data pipelines. When we have intermediate datasets that are reused multiple times in our computations, we can use the cache() method to store those datasets in memory. This prevents the need to recompute the same data repeatedly, resulting in significant time savings.

Interviewer: How about persisting data to disk?

Interviewee: Persisting data to disk using the persist() method is useful when we have limited memory and need to manage the memory footprint carefully. We can choose to persist certain datasets to disk rather than keeping them all in memory. This ensures that our Spark application runs efficiently and avoids potential Out of Memory (OOM) errors.
Interviewer: Can you give an example of when to use cache and persist in a Spark job?

Interviewee: Sure! Let's consider a scenario where we have a complex transformation process with multiple stages. In one of the early stages, we perform some expensive computations that result in an intermediate dataset. Since this dataset is used in subsequent stages of the computation, we can use cache() to store it in memory. This way, we avoid recomputing it in each subsequent stage, which can save a lot of processing time.

Interviewer: Is there anything else you would like to add about leveraging cache and persist in Spark? Interviewee: Yes, it's crucial to use these techniques judiciously, considering the size of the datasets and
available memory. For smaller datasets that can easily fit into memory, caching them entirely may be a good option. However, for larger datasets that exceed available memory, we can use a combination of caching and persisting to achieve the right balance between performance and memory management.

Interviewer: Your understanding of cache and persist in Spark is impressive. It's clear that you know how to
optimize Spark applications efficiently.

Interviewee: I believe that leveraging cache and persist appropriately can lead to significant performance gains, and it's essential to consider these techniques while designing Spark data pipelines.
